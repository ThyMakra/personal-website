        intro: "I build applications that scale. In several years of professional work as Software Engineer and Engineering Manager I successfully designed, launched and maintained a variety of web and mobile applications. With a vast skill set I am able to find and leverage the most suitable technology for every problem. As Full-Stack Engineer, I develop robust backends with modern technologies such as GraphQL as well as creative and user-friendly frontends that deliver the best possible user experience across different browsers and flexible hybrid mobile applications. When developing software, with an AGILE approach, I put my focus on cost efficiency, scalability and maintainability."

        frontendText: "The past decade has seen my frontend development stack evolve from utilising basic HTML, CSS and sprinkles of Javascript to leveraging modern workflows. These are deep rooted with component based frameworks that align with build tools and transpilers such as Webpack, Rollup and Babel. This results in robust Single Page Apps as well as Progressive Web Apps. Throughout my career I've also designed and launched several mobile applications with hybrid solutions like React Native. I am familiar with all major frontend architectures from client side routing over server side rendering to the JAMstack.",

        backendText: "Choosing the most efficient technology mix for a project is an art that is difficult to master. Finding the right tools does not only require a clear vision and good understanding of the scope of the project but also a deep understanding of the impact different technologies can have. Working on a variety of projects in different sectors with several technologies and programming languages taught me their implications business and technology wise. My know-how paired with my analytical and forward-thinkin approach enable me to develop backend architectures that are maintainbale and easy to scale."
